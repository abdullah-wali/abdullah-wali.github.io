This wearable glove translates sign language gestures into spoken English in real-time, enabling deaf and speech-impaired users to communicate verbally without human interpreters. It overcomes the critical barrier of interpreter dependency, especially in emergency situations or hospitals.

## The Problem

Speech and hearing impaired people have enjoyed the advent of standardized sign languages for communicating with each other. However, the main downside of this mode of communication is their inability to communicate with non-communicators of sign language, which is predominantly the population at large. World Federation of Deaf claims only 70 million people know sign languages (which is quite small, proportionally, when compared to the 8 billion population of our Globe!)

Communication with people who don't understand sign language would require translators (a person who is capable of translating sign language into voice and vice versa), presenting a significant challenge as translators are not available all the time, especially during an emergency situation or in hospitals, and can be quite costly.

## The Solution

My project aims to address this issue through an affordable Arduino Nano-based wearable glove device. The user simply gestures hand signs, which the microcontroller translates in real-time into English or pre-programmed prompts. The output messages are delivered visually on a screen, like a 16x2 LCD or your smartphone, and orally via a connected smartphone or any other compatible device, eliminating the necessity of a translator and enabling easy, cost-effective and seamless communication with the general population.
